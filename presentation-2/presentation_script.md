# Presentation 2: Applying the model to a given Use-Case

## Guiding Questions:
- Explain how your approach could be used for our use case
  - keep it realistic
- Can your approach be used for this use case?
  - if not directly, why not?
  - Could you adapt your approach?
- How exactly would your approach work?
- What data would you need for your approach?
- How could you evaluate whether your approach works?

## What we get:
- Overall goal: Based on how **difficult** a specific learning objective is for a student, we want to **recommend them exercises fitting to their skill level**
- difficulty rating for each student and each learning objective (easy, medium, difficult)
- We don't get a difficulty rating for the exercises
