  abstract = {Because a user's behavior depends mainly on the user's current interests, which can change over time, the sequential recommendation approach has become more prevalent in recommender systems. Many methods have been proposed that aim to model sequential recommendations. One of these is BERT4Rec, which applies the bidirectional-encoder-representations-from-transformers (BERT) technique to model user behavior sequences by considering the target user's historical data, i.e., a content-based filtering (CBF) approach. Despite BERT4Rec's effectiveness, we argue that considering only this historical data is insufficient to provide the most accurate recommendation. We believe that if BERT were to consider other users' interactions in its analysis, it would increase the model accuracy. Therefore, we propose a new method called HybridBERT4Rec, which applies BERT to both CBF and collaborative filtering (CF). For CBF, we want to extract the characteristics of the target user's interactions with purchased items. (We implement this in the same way as in BERT4Rec, with our model generating a target user profile.) For CF, we want to find neighboring users who are similar to the target user. Here, we extract the target item's characteristics using all other users who rated the target item as a second input to BERT. This generates a target item profile. After obtaining both profiles, we use them to predict a rating score. We experimented with three datasets, finding that our model was more accurate than the original BERT4Rec.},

  abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation -- collaborative filtering -- on the basis of implicit feedback. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering -- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},

  abstract = {An e-learning recommender system (RS) aims to generate personalized recommendations based on learner preferences and goals. The existing RSs in the e-learning domain still exhibit drawbacks due to its inability to consider the learner characteristics in the recommendation process. In this paper, we are dealing with the new user cold-start problem, which is a major drawback in e-learning content RSs. This problem can be mitigated by incorporating additional learner data in the recommendation process. This paper proposes an ontology-based (OB) content recommender system for addressing the new user cold-start problem. In the proposed recommendation model, ontology is used to model the learner and learning objects with their characteristics. Collaborative and content-based filtering techniques are used in the recommendation model to generate the top N recommendations based on learner ratings. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance and prediction accuracy of the proposed model in cold-start conditions using the evaluation metrics mean absolute error, precision and recall. The proposed model provides more reliable and personalized recommendations by making use of ontological domain knowledge.},

  abstract = {Modeling users' dynamic and evolving preferences from their historical behaviors is challenging and crucial for recommendation systems. Previous methods employ sequential neural networks (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network) to encode users' historical interactions from left to right into hidden representations for making recommendations. Although these methods achieve satisfactory results, they often assume a rigidly ordered sequence which is not always practical. We argue that such left-to-right unidirectional architectures restrict the power of the historical sequence representations. For this purpose, we introduce a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for sequential Recommendation (BERT4Rec). However, jointly conditioning on both left and right context in deep bidirectional model would make the training become trivial since each item can indirectly "see the target item". To address this problem, we train the bidirectional model using the Cloze task, predicting the masked items in the sequence by jointly conditioning on their left and right context. Comparing with predicting the next item at each position in a sequence, the Cloze task can produce more samples to train a more powerful bidirectional model. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models consistently.},

  abstract = {Next basket recommendation becomes an increasing concern. Most conventional models explore either sequential transaction features or general interests of users. Further, some works treat users' general interests and sequential behaviors as two totally divided matters, and then combine them in some way for next basket recommendation. Moreover, the state-of-the-art models are based on the assumption of Markov Chains (MC), which only capture local sequential features between two adjacent baskets. In this work, we propose a novel model, Dynamic REcurrent bAsket Model (DREAM), based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). DREAM not only learns a dynamic representation of a user but also captures global sequential features among baskets. The dynamic representation of a specific user can reveal user's dynamic interests at different time, and the global sequential features reflect interactions of all baskets of the user over time. Experiment results on two public datasets indicate that DREAM is more effective than the state-of-the-art models for next basket recommendation.},
